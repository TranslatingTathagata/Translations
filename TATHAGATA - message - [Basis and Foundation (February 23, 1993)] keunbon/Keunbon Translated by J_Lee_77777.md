### Basis and Foundation Those who seek good fruits must first have good basis,  And those who seek good basis must first have good foundation.  This is the law of cause and effect that exist in the realm of life,  Ignoring this law will lead to ruining oneself.  When a person attains enlightenment,  One will know the works of the basis and foundation that cause everything to be,  Knowing this will lead one to attain his hopes through himself.   Splitting of a bean causes bean leaf to grow,  Bean leaf leads to beans to grow,  As the bean disappears, it is with its leaf,  And as bean leaf disappears, it is with the bean.  Everything that is born and deceased will be in such a cycle,  Oneâ€™s happiness and misfortune are the effects of series of relationships of oneself. When there is no relationship, it is difficult to meet even when near,  But having relationship allows ones to meet even while far away,  The blessing of living is to attain health, happiness and everlasting life.   Present is a result of the past, and future will be the result of the present,  The relationships connecting the past, present and future is turning like a wheel.   &lt;February 23, 1993&gt;
