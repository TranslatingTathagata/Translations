Preface

God made a promise to the world in the beginning. As he created all things, he defined meanings through laws that he had made all living things, before humanity, to keep time and transformations.

Particularly, he instructed man to keep that fate while he was making man. Then through deeds, he taught to have peace and blessing in their hearts, as such, man received the ability to save his own soul.

Through the words of <Lamentation>, the author has explained the law of deeds as how people will choose between blessing and misfortune as they keep the fate.

People have said that it is a self-betrayal to want blessings from God in the midst of restlessness without keeping this behavior.

The law of human society is co-existence, and this is an absolute promise. When this law is not firm, the society becomes uncertain and its anticipation would be lost in darkness.

One simple conclusion is that people have lost the promise of those days as they have lost their own spirits. Such a situation is like them having chosen the unfortunate path of self-enslavement.

Betrayal of moral laws and mistrust of close surroundings come from the destruction of the laws, thus glory and peace of an era rise from conscience and courage.

The laws must be fair to everyone like a scale and it must be a necessary existence to all.

The most anxious thing in the world that we live in today is the corruption of the laws.

In the world, in which the advancement of materialistic culture caused the power of science to push out conscience, the laws are threatening the values and the value system of the people who live in that time.

When the law cannot speak for conscience, the world will become such that means will be ahead of all actions of people.

Those people who did not like the era of knowing distrust, they no longer need to keep endless fear.

If you long for happiness and peace, the laws of conscience must always be kept in your hearts.

Epilogue






1. The mind’s rapids



I ask my mind

After asking my mind
I write a poem
The moments of happiness, sadness and aches
Having gone through it all
I look into the mind
Should I write it like a song
Should I write it like a letter
Without reading a book of poems
Without buying a book of poems
The question that had been asked
How does one write a poem
Should I write it like a novel
Should I write it like a diary
After setting fire in my heart
I look into my mind




The mind and the body

Is the mind limitlessly deep and wide
Like the market for hope and despair
Selling desires
Buying desires
There is a world of desire
Yearning for pain
Pleasure
And death
It becomes a world of spirits

Is the body a world of affection
Hot as fire
Like a street filled with fog
Where there were strange eyes
Always dreaming and
Calling the mind

Thinking about the sky with as much greed as possible
Thinking about the earth with as much greed as possible
Where I was afraid of myself
There is a world of spirits




Conscience and sword

As there is a sword in the mind
And there is conscience in the mind
There is laughter in people’s minds
And there are tears

Those that were foolish 
Have given up writing
And were throwing away a hoe

The thing that truly made me fear
Was there are no longer any benevolent people

Time is a sad thing
Those who try to protect
Those who were unfortunate
Those people’s eyes
Being tainted with resentment and hatred
Having known the past
Lamentation and regret
Fill the heart




Prayer

Having collected my mind to the tip of my hands
I am reciting a chant
Thinking about my own desires
I am reciting a chant

To achieve the things that have not been achieved
I am chanting a spell

To learn of one’s own anxious mind
I am chanting a spell




Time

Each time I look into a mirror
The reflection in the glass
Shows lines in the face

That boring
Time
Passes each day
Deceiving me
In that vast world
There is no place to hide

This one body as I look upon it
Once again
As if to be waiting on something
My anxious mind
Sees time




A world is

A world’s promise is about 5,000 years
As the time does not stand still
Who will break that solemn promise

Billions of lives and spirits

Do not know the things to come
And time is hurried
By the next world

The true aching mind 
Where 
Should we go
The place of refuge
There is a promise




Promised Land

The country of the East Sea
There is the Three God Mountain
As four seasons return
Each year
The vitality of the sky
Is settled over the ground

The evil spirits of the world
The place that was coveted by them
Having been persecuted
And as there is a grudge among the people

There was a time of pounding one’s chest
As a person’s heart
Covers the mind
Is the promise still
Far away

If someone knows what will come about
Breaking this place’s great misfortune
The will of heaven
Is being heard




Heaven

Are both far and near
Heaven
Anyone
Can be chosen
And tested

The greedy
The liars
The place that they cannot go 
Heaven

If born in the world
You are chosen
And tested

The place that is travelled by mind
Heaven
Even if yearning to go
The place that one cannot go
Heaven

For those people who are good
Far, yet near
There was a road
To heaven




News of spring

The fresh greens
That sprung up in the fields
The children in the country
Are picking them

Looking into the large basket
Brings joy
Someone is humming
A song




Mind and will

To live well or not
Is the will of a person

What use is it to lament on one’s destiny
Nothing can be done of the past
Foolishness becomes a burden
Bright mind becomes a meaning
A journey through one’s lifetime
Is like a summer night’s dream




The road home

The child I saw in the old days
Has become an adult
Calling over a grown son 
To say hello
With burnt face
I look up to the sky

Having built a railway
Next to the river’s hill
There is a new highway on the bank
And he built a station




Desire

The murky things in the world
Are burning my heart
A heart of goodness and a heart of hatred
Boil inside

Even with the hidden grace
In the heart
There is only anxiety
Over what’s immediately ahead




Grudge

As conscience becomes sin
There is no ground to stand on
Weathering all the hardships and privations
There is no place to rest

Having the power of 1000 people
Yet, not being able to use it
Is to be born in the world
By fate alone




A song of spirit

Even though I call on the time
It does not return
As life gets old
There is only death

What is the use of keeping desire

As there is nothing to leave behind
What is told to the future generation
Is only a name




The sound of a bell

A bell rings
In the dawn of the morning
Whose sleep
Will it awake today

The yell of
Calling out the penitents
Reverberates in the air
Of the morning sky




Road

What is higher than an emperor
Is in the meaning
What is more precious than wealth
Is in penance

As I keep my ridicule to myself
I walk the way of solitude
To establish laws




Ordeals

Ordeals
You have woken up
My foolish self

You have passed me
Leaving behind a teaching
That is more illuminating 

More serious
Than any other teachers in this world

On the lonesome eyes
Before the sad eyes
As it changes my mind
Even if I feel lonely in the world
You 
Are in me
And always taught you as your teacher




The law is like the pendulum of a scale

In the laws of the world
There is happiness
In the laws of the world
There is misfortune

God gives us meaning
And looks into our hearts
The hopes of the poor
The anxieties of the wealthy
And even the fears of having received the heaven and the earth
It is the reading on the scale, measuring the heart
God looks into our hearts




Come to me

All those who are in despair and fearful
When your minds become
The pit of the swamp
I’ll tell you
I’ll tell you

The world has hidden everything
And the world has made everything
For hopes and happiness
And to reacquaint with conscience
I’ll tell you
I’ll tell you




Looking at the sky

Looking at the sky
By that blueness
There is still life
The sun that was glaring
The moon and the stars that lit the darkness
The world hasn’t changed yet

I look into my mind that has changed over time
Each day, within the desires of my mind
I ask for a new dream again on this day 




My lord

I praise you
Before your name
I learned to ache in that short life time
And loved you
For the happiness of those who are good
For that long time
You are in the world

And the great meaning of yours
Is as beautiful as an angel’s singing

Were you the God of peace and love

The world
Is bowing
Before your name

Even in the foolish
Mind of mine
Gathers thoughts
I have jumped
With astonishment

What we cannot 
Forget forever 
Is your love

Even now
Each time an unfortunate event occurs
The world
Thinks of you

And offered the time
Of longing acts




2. Time of Lamentation
	
Lamentation

Until the end of the world
In the hearts of humans
There remains lamentation

Even if the time passes
In the hearts of people
There remains foolishness

And the heart of a good person
Has no place
What has endlessly existed
Was the lamentation of the heart

God does not come
And people do not know the will of God
As righteous and unrighteous cannot be discerned
In the hearts of people
There remain desires




Mother’s heart

Mother, my mother
You gave me birth
And experienced heartache

My mother
After giving birth to a son
The tears that were in your eyes
Are standing in my heart

Mother, my mother
For the sake of your unfortunate son
You’ve offered prayer of wishes each day
And as you called on a God
You’ve shed tears for your son

My mother’s love
It is still standing in my heart even now

Mother
My mother
The day you left me behind
And closed your eyes 
Leaving her young son behind
And turned her head
The sorrow of my mother
It is still standing in my heart.




Anticipation of spring day

On a warm spring day
A small dream
A swallow that flew to Kangnam
Bring me a pumpkin seed
So there will be visitors at my lonely home


When you pick azalea
When you pick forsythia
On the mountain that belongs to no one
I chase after spring
Dear time, dear time
Will it chase after a lonely dream




Bankruptcy

A tragedy of fate
At the young age of 12
There was a terrifying sentence
As if people would see a heavy burden
They avoided me

And worse than a dog
My heart has become miserable


On the mind of the world
I’ve become a childish clown
The words out of people’s mouths
My behavior reflects me




Visit

A young conscience shakes
Like a guest
When deceiving
The heart shakes
The dread of a night
With a recognition
As a relative 
By the people
I’ve met for the first time
In the space of a small room
With lingering attachment
At the feet of people
Curling up [hunching/crouching] my heart
I passed a sleepless night

Ah ah, I’m scared

Clasping the bladder
I see the darkness




A diary of a 15 year old boy

My hunger is
Sadness and fear
One body, one mind
I look at the world
Before the eyes of strangers

I sell laughter
Crushing [squashing] one small body
I live the day

When the dawn breaks
The fearful reality
When the sun sets
A scary dream

Before the fire of the furnace
The wind blows
Ah ah, it’s hot
Ah ah, it’s hot




When August comes


On the morning of Thanksgiving Day
Before the ancestral offering table
That was prepared with earnest

I kneel on my knees
My mother’s face
That I longed for
Whether there will be a visit from ancestor 
Or not

When that day comes
Mother 
Who taught the son to forget poverty
Now awaits her son
Even when the top of the deserted grave
Was filled with overgrown weeds
It was my mother’s face that I had awaited in silence




A dream that was dreamed every day

I dreamed every day
A dream in the sky
To seek peace
I dreamed
At the ladders used to climb up to the clouds
My mind was in the sky

I dreamed
I dreamed every day
Towards the air, towards the air
To see heaven
I dreamed




The affection of the body

The spirit is going blind
Before burning temptation
Made up like a clown
A mind
The skin is burning
Ah ah, the pleasure and futility
The sound of regrets of the spirit
Reaches my mind

My heart is burning
Before the burning eyes
Wealth and greed are burning
One life one wish
Burning in the body

Ah ah, the endless affection
The sound of regrets of the spirit
It reaches my mind




The cemetery

On a rainy day
At the cemetery
A cry of a spirit was heard

Still
Unable to forget the old days
And wandering the world
A cry of a spirit is heard

All that grudge

Held in its heart
Waiting for penitence
A cry of a spirit is heard

Now and again
Calling for regret and lamentation
A cry of a spirit is heard




Words of a parrot

Should I still trust
The words of a parrot
Being deceived each day
My dejected heart
Should I still trust
The words of a parrot
The period of loneliness that burned my heart
Should I still trust the words of a parrot




The king’s people

In my heart
In the brethren’s hearts
Those who have lived for the king
There was the blood of our ancestors

For the king
Built the walls of fortress
And killed the talented people

There was the blood of our ancestors

Having left behind all that grudge
To forget the pain
Before the loyal servant of the king
Built the shrines
And became the king’s people
There is the blood of our ancestors in our hearts.




A song to teach fear

Wanting freedom
People gathered
And sang

Wanting to forget fear
They sang

In the basement
Of a country church
Thinking about homeland
They sang

Do not fear
Do not fear
We to ourselves
Lest we be fearful
They sang

And for other people
To hear as well
They sang
The people who wanted freedom
To have the world hear
They sang




To someone

Expressing sympathy to someone in his bereavement
I offer a heart of sympathy
Never again
When you reincarnate
Torment your conscience

Like the greedy devil
When he makes slaves of people
You, like a hero
Like the emperor of darkness
The world is feared
And the world is new
Even Lies
As can be made to look like truths
There is magic
Even the politicians
Even the religious
Even the poets
Even the authors	
Everyone
Is lowering his head in fear of conscience
But
You have awakened us
The fear of darkness
You’ve told us
In our minds, in the distant future
You’ve 
Taught us the light of conscience




What did those people want

It is strange
For a measuring tool
They are making a scale
Their minds
Cannot speak
Close their eyes
Close their ears
And just watch television
And like a friend
Do enjoy yourselves

Hard liquor in one area
And swords at another area they sell
Songs
And tears
During that short time
As if magicians
They are changing their hearts




 What is sin

People live
The past and the future
There is only one fate
The sadness
And fear
And hope they live
Where does sadness come from
Where does fear come from
And where does hope come from
Even if there is despair in the world
One body
One mind
Dream is there
There always was
A dream
A peace
Wanting mind




Moral laws

Strong winds bring dark clouds
Those people who waited for the rain
Burn their hearts

Ah ah heavens I fear
Dark are the sky and earth
Thunder and lightning
The streams of water that swept away the world
Now comes despair again
Like an overflowing river 

The village swept away and changed 
Through the mouths of father and son
It becomes the sound of lamentation
Moral laws
Moral laws




Sermon

The pastor
At each worship
When he sees people
He preaches
Like the clouds
The words that carry the mind
God is great

Before the people
Who are longing for peace
The words of each day
Believe in Christ
Like Jesus
He speaks not

With muddied rules
According to his own assessment
He preaches




Peace is not being kept

Who wants peace
Who is demolishing peace
Did the world push everything out to God
People hide their, what were, foolish minds
Each day, they become wandering eyes
They go on with their fates as burdens

Ah ah, it is foolish
Because one fears oneself
There is always one habit
They hold expectations and desires in their hearts
As there is still a dream, I seek sleep
People do not make peace
Rather, people try to dream peace




O history, I speak

O history
Our story
That will
Always be told
By you

The events of my sadness
The events of my brethrens’ sadness
I sing before you
Hypocrisy was not peace
And hypocrisy was not a promise
Where is he who was deceiving us
I ask you
Who has been living for us
I tell you
In the distant future and again before the brethren
To sing that hypocrisy was fearful 




To brethren who have become a spirit

Brethren
At an inn in Seoul
During a night of sleeplessness
Our story
Of cherishing the homeland
There were two hearts

But now there is only me
I feel loneliness
Are we not able to meet again forever
When thinking of you 
You, who is asleep looking over the vast field
I feel a rage

There is no one to speak to now
I watch the pain of the homeland alone
For what reason have you died
As I look into what had been my burning heart
The world
Like friend and brethren have left
I cannot forget you as I’m lonely
Each day is a dread

The one who loved the homeland
Your spirit
Have you not forgotten the homeland
That you remain here still, I ask




The Hill of Golgotha

Even today
People still talk about the story
Of what happened at Golgotha
The one who loved the world
The people who killed the righteous one
The stories of the people of Jerusalem

Referring to that sin	
As the betrayal of Judas
As it is said
Even the story of priests
Even the story of a thief
Their own consciences
They hide




3. A letter to the people



A letter to the people

Dear people
Today
There is a chance
To speak of truth
No matter what you say
There was a chance
To have known you
For the homeland
What I couldn’t hold inside
That your future
My future
Are being decided again now

For this very crucial moment
What I speak is
Of pain, of despair
And the end

Those people who praised
Of beautiful voices
By the temptation of those words
Even if at the point of sacrificing your spirits
Those who wanted bread and freedom
Do think of the homeland
My pain
The homeland’s pain
By you
Let all be saved




Dear People

There is a territory between the North and South Koreas
There is pain in the hearts of countrymen
There are faces of blood relatives that cannot meet
There are hearts that were buried over the time
The awaited unification
The wish of every day
We are of one mind




Descendants of Dangun

Let’s sing for the people
The beautiful Kumkang Mountain
The mysterious Jiri Mountain
And even the Halla Mountain under the sea
They can become Three God Mountain only if they meet

Calling for unification
The cries of people
Who has made the 38th parallel
As grudge builds in the hearts of the countrymen
Our one mind
The descendants of Dangun
Let’s sing for the people




There is a mind

As if the end of pain and despair was reached
Looking into the lonely conscience
Hiding
A humble body and a white flag

The mind in the life
Of hypocrisy and fear
Is being looked on




Let’s make peace

Let’s make peace
However, you speak
For you
For me
For the world
Even if there are good things to say
Without a promise
Disappointment is huge
And again tomorrow
If a mind and a mind break
Fear will creep in
In the world of broken conscience
Like our hope
In the future of the people
You, first
A promise of peace
Be spoken




Emergency measure

Let no one hold a torch
As it reflects that terrifying shape
Conscience should not be heard
Conscience should not be seen
The temptation that targeted the fallen
Those many words
And the many words that defeated the good people
Again when they become the darkness of the world
So that day will not break
Chasing away the light
Ah the scary sounds




The mind of a good person

A good person’s
Mind
Looks at the world
As if his own shadow
Has become his darkness

In the world of sleeping conscience
Like a hope waking up the pain
A good person’s	
Mind
Looks at oneself

For the righteousness of life
That mind lives in the world
To receive the light of spirit
In endless waiting
Was a scary ordeal

A good man
Looks at oneself




The acts of foolishness

They were
Very foolish
Rather than waking up hope
They were waking up despair
Like a person in a hurry
Without knowing the truth
Of those who were deceiving themselves
For those cowardly people
The people applauded

Wanting peace
But now
For the changed mind and face
They applauded for hypocrisy




Those people’s current address

The world is truly strange
The mind of a misfortunate person lives
The conscience of a truthful person lives
And the desire of a thief lives
Where do they all live




The tree that lost its season

With a tree that had lost its season
O the spring that couldn’t blossom flowers
In the warm room of the wealthy
On the top of the poor man’s crock stand
It withers and freezes

The desires of people
And in the midst of people’s indifference
Now, as if it had lost its season
On the top of the tree
That had fallen asleep again
The flowers are drawn by the artists’ hands
The spring as it had been in the old days
Drawn were even the butterflies

But unable to break the scent of flowers
O how I miss
O time




The magic in the darkness

How strange
The goblin’s club
Do you know its secret
Wait
That’s darkness
When you
Close your eyes
Woman
Wine
And all that much wealth were acquired




Scream

O the world that has fallen
O Drug addicts
O the words that were regurgitated in your mouth
The body that is rotting
Burning fireball of madness
O the conscience that had gone mad
And now muddied pupils
Nothing to anticipate
Has even the despair disappeared

To save the last remaining drop of the syringe
At the face that was deceiving the world
I’ve seen the pain
Of countless many people

When was it
When you burn your hearts
The aches of my heart
The sadness in my mind
Even the reason that I couldn’t share

Become the voice of regret
Who could speak
Of the event of that day




One drink

You are a friend
You are a comrade
In the barren heart of mine
Like drizzling rain
It has moistened my mind

It become tears
Always
When lonesome
It accompanies my mind
You are a friend
You are a comrade
Like a man when fearful
There is bravery
Friendly when lonely
You become my lover




Some answer

Everyone puts on a mask
You cannot even tell a truth
False accusation and groundless rumors punish you
It is self-indulgence of freedom
Hunger is due to ancestors
You should wait
And if you should die eventually
That’s because you have no need for anything


	

People who are on the stage

In the world
There is a strange stage
Uninteresting lines
Is the story of a lonely person

Like a mad person
The fallen words are readily spoken
When this scene ends
The speech of
The actor
Speaks of a misfortunate drunkard in every line

And becomes an angel
When that kind face	
Steals the simple mind
To make it impossible to see the next
The curtain closes




Hypocrisy

From the history of Israel
I think of how scary it is
The humans’ hypocrisy that is
Hypocrisy of people
Serves God
For the many sinned spirits

When that day came
In Jerusalem
Before the sinless
I see the hypocrisy that sentenced death
O that scary event
It still becomes a question in my mind
For the sake of evidence
Their fates are in the world as nomads

The spirit of a Jew
Who was reborn again
The world has seen it
The event of that day




The homeland

The sound of ”Long live Korea”
It reaches the ear
The cries of torture
We see the sadness of the family members
Even one’s own pain
Had to scream ”Long live Korea”
Their spirits 
Were truly our
Pride
And conscience
The Republic of Korea
Is a democratic republic
As when so proclaimed
In the hearts of people
That waited for hopes
Is the story of
Promised prosperity and happiness
Again
The heart burns
The sound of conscience




Our judgment

Now God
Tests us with respect to
Our consciences
Our hypocrisy
And our cowardliness

No matter what we think
He made us do things
Our way

In our hearts
He gave light and darkness
And whether our foolishness
Is in the world or not
God has deserted us to be judged




When March comes

When March comes
In my heart
There are cries of those who were enraged
For the independence
For the freedom
The beautiful mind like a dream
The conscience that moved
For the future of the brethren
It pounds my chest as it comes
For the spirits of countless many people
Like the wind
As if the season arrives
It comes to heart

Screamed upon seeing the people
Screamed upon seeing the homeland
The burning voice comes to my heart




Speaking

The lonely people are speaking
Speaking of things that shame themselves
The poor people are speaking
They readily speak of living well and eating well so as to boast

Those who fear themselves are speaking
Now there are no friends
Now there is no comrade
They speak of their ugly child without an end

The people with sins are speaking
There is no heaven
There is no hell
They speak that they do not have their own spirits




O conscience, be a martyr for the home country

Do you have a home country
Do you belong to an ethnic group
At last, there is the sound that has awakened conscience
In the dark
There is the scary sound
Telling you to light up
O conscience, be a martyr
For your home country




4. Where are we going



I ask again

My mind becomes
A doubting ocean
Sounds of wind and water
And sees the drifting waterway

In the midst of darkness 
Foretelling between
Despair and hope
Where should we go
My silence
Is not yet awake
In the darkness
Where are we going




A hope sent each day

Untethered
My hope
Is sent
To heaven
Before the angels

My mind
From within the body
As the world is dark
I ask for light




A letter to God

O God, we have lost peace
People have made laws as they pleased
Now, conscience has lost the ownership of that long period
And in the midst of the laughter of the fallen and a poet’s lamentation 
The spirit wanders that dark mind

The mind that shunned the lights of the sun and the moon
At the juncture of life and death
Undying cherished desire that somehow rises
We prayed to have peace among us




A city of imitation

In the streets
The cross of a church comes into view
And there are
The book
And story
Of going to heaven
However,
What is strange is
There is no truth in the streets yet
There is no one who
Speaks the laws towards heaven
Now, like a city of clowns
Everyone looks into their own minds
While in the city of imitation

Yet
What is comforting is
People pretend to
Not yet have forgotten the story of God




Fortune telling

Like a leaf
Falling in the air 
After autumn
I look into the mind

Foolishly
Waited for a good luck
From the lips 
Of a liar
Wanted to learn my own destiny
 I look at the footsteps
Like a small anticipation
Buying the time of boredom
I look into the mind
I look into the stories that never returned




A bookstore where conscience is not selling

The words of geniuses
Are judged by fools
Please do not write truths
Instead these days
Please write the experiences of thieves
And swindlers’ moving stories
Even the stories of disgraced monks
And the stories of prostitutes
If you write them
You will be a great author




Now is the age of television

Today, as if to tell the age of television
The faces of actors
The voices of anchors
Steal the eyes and ears 
From the people each day

The modern magic that reaches into the main room of the house
Divides the closeness of father and children
The sounds of stadiums
The sounds of singers’ singing
Cause the lonely spirit to be exhausted
And now
Television tries to decide on everything




Truth does not dance

When sun sets
Neon lights come on in the streets	
Like a jewel
They shine
Catching the minds of those who are lonely
There gather 
Countless many people
Again filling today
The halls with bright lights

Man holds woman’s hand
Woman holds man’s hand
Have they even forgotten shame
They embrace each other wildly

Truth does not dance
Moving to the melody
They look into the minds
When the lonely hearts 
Meet
O ill spirits



The foolish world

O God
Now, we are wandering in the midst of darkness 
Indifference
And desire
And a mind that was jealous

Like a changed curse
We saw the conscience
Love and
Friendship were thrown away
Upon seeing such people
Again today
Up the cliff
We have endlessly climbed 




There are people buying heaven now

Even now
There are people buying heaven
The cherished wish	
The prayer
As if they were God’s people
Wait each day
For requests and commands

Even now
They
Before us
Open not the heaven’s laws
As they cannot meet God




Dream

I dream
A dream of a world
My mind, passing the buildings and churches
Head to a temple, crossing the river and mountains
And again, I look into the minds of people

I dream
A dream of heaven
My mind carries air and stars
I look to the peaceful customs of heaven
At last, I see the mind of a good person

I dream
A dream of hell
My mind, crossing a fog-covered river
I see the fortress walls, tools of torture and prison
At last, I see the mind of a fool





I look at the world.
I’ve wandered endlessly to tell others of the value of my birth.
I had to keep the life of encountering abuse, persecution and disdain and
What pained my heart again was the future world that was losing conscience.
O God
Grant us peace.
I’ve written these words for the cherished wishes of those who are powerless.


God does not come.
In order to save oneself
Everyone must believe in God and keep the laws.
