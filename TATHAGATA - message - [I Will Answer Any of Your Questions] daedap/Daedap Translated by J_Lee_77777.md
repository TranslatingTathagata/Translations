### I will answer any of your questions. All things exist in the world.  Living is a path to self-birth, and truthfulness is the important thing that human must know.  This truthfulness becomes the basis of everything that happens before you.  Most of the misfortunes that humans experience are the resulting phenomenon of self produced relationships,  Such meanings do not change unless new relationships are touched upon.  This meaning was the root cause that the creator had based upon when the world was created  Meaning is the resulting form of collective phenomenon,  Phenomenon is the resulting form from the meaning.  Everything in the world exists through such repetitious phenomenon and comes to be.  The most terrifying adversary before the humans in this world is indifference.   &lt;From Pagoda Park, March 13 â€“ March 22, 1991&gt;
