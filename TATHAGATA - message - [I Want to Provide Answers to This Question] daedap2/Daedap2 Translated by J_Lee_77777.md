### I want to provide answers to this question
 
There exists one principle in the world.  
This principle will never change as long as the world exits.  
All answers are predetermined and truthfulness can only be verified through problems.  
The prophecy of a coming end of the world, in this age, has been passed down for a long time.  
Such phenomenon occurs as one world transitions to a new world, and the result itself will be determined based on the problems that are currently within us.  
The higher risks for the humanity today, as opposed to the past existed humanities is because the todayâ€™s ongoing problems are serious.  
Such things place all life forms that exist in this world into not only extinction, but can also throw humanity itself into risk.  
In order to resolve such things, it is imperative to reveal the facts about what is causing such things to exist, and must uncover the principles that apply to them.  
In the current situation, no other method exists, and neither is ample amount of time given to us.  
Yet, the reason that hope still remains is because all decisions may be altered at any time, and path to redeeming oneself also manifests in oneself.
