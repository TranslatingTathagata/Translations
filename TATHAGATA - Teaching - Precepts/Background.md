Paul S corresponded with J Lee to perform a few revisions. Care was taken to attempt to produce close translations. For example, the word "가슴속" was decided as being translated as "heart" rather than "mind" as it's often used to indicate one's innermost thoughts.  Meanwhile, the term "마음" has generally been translated as "mind" based on the context, even though it could be translated as "heart". A reading of the original Korean text with context is necessary to properly understand the true meanings of the real text.
