# Translation 1 by JLee on Mar 8 2019

Paul S corresponded with J Lee to perform a few revisions. Care was taken to attempt to produce close translations. For example, the word "가슴속" was decided as being translated as "heart" rather than "mind" as it's often used to indicate one's innermost thoughts.  Meanwhile, the term "마음" has generally been translated as "mind" based on the context, even though it could be translated as "heart". Please be aware as well that the word "교화" may actually best be translated as "enlightenments" rather than "understandings", but since I do not speak Korean, and since Tathagata isn't here for us to ask anymore, I'm not able to say which one it should be. A reading of the original Korean text with context would be necessary to properly understand the true meanings of the real text.
