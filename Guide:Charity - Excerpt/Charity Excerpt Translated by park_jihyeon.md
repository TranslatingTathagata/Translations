COME. 
SEE.
LISTEN.
AND TELL A MESSAGE.
Then you will get everything that you want.~~~ It is the most grateful word among the words that Buddha sought to bless people. By the way why does he say that?:
 ‘Come’ To blind people without connection to our beliefs.
  ‘See’ To blind people who can not see.
  ‘Listen’ To blind people who can not hear.
  ‘Tell a message’ To blind people who can not speak. 
 People often enjoy praying to God for something that they could not get by their own strength.
Let it be what it wants to do.
Other people have something that I do not have for myself.
Good fate, desired fate.
Good life, desired life.
Good future, desired future.
 So the Buddha who came to the world tell them how they can get what they want.

~~~SEE.Try fiercely to see what there is and what that is (truth). 
First look at the truth. My words and my actions are true. 
Try fiercely to see what you have and what you have done (the truth). 
First look at the truth. My words and my actions are true. LISTEN.Try fiercely to hear what there is and what that is (truth). 
First look at the truth. My words and my actions are true. 
Try fiercely to hear what you have and what you have done (the truth). 
First look at the truth. My words and my actions are true.  Tell a message.Tell my honesty and my honest to the world. 
Listen to my words and tell them what you have seen and what you have heard. 
Tell the message to the person you love most in the world. This is the only way I can bless you. It is also the only way you can bless yourself.~~~  ~~~“I hate myself for being smart and for realized it. 
I just want to give everyone and opportunity to get something good. 
I am proud of myself if I have been good and blessed because of what I have done. 
Otherwise my life is a shameful life. 
When just doing nothing but yourself, you would look so shameful. 
But if I do this myself and I do not get any results in the world, it is not my fault.”~~~
