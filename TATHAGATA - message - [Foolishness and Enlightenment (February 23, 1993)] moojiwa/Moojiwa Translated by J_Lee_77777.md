### Foolishness and Enlightenment Foolishness is the root cause of sin.  Enlightenment is the path to forgiving sin.  All paths are within relationships,  Being born and dying are also different.   Life is because there is a big meaning in the world,  And as life leads to code of law,  There are worldly events in the law.  Holy man has difficulty attaining the human kind,  Humans have difficulty of deserting oneself and following even after encountering a holy man.  Not knowing living causes living to be in falsehood, Knowing the living causes living to be painful,  As not having piety leads to not to enlightenment,  There is no way to serve oneself without enlightenment.  How can one say that things in this world are elsewhere.   Truly regrettable and frustrating things were in relationships,  There is no understanding of what is before your eyes without relationships.  Being deceived builds work and acts of deceiving also builds work,  As it is difficult to be born into the human world even for once,  Deceiving and being deceived causes ruining the human paths.   Truly precious and precious things are in one-self,  Mankind does not know the things of the living,  It is hard and difficult to save oneself.   &lt;February 23, 1993&gt;
