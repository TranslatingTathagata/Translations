Effort

 

I enlighten you,

And your achievements require your own efforts.

 

By listening to my words

When you encounter unfamiliar things,

 
By having interest in a fact,

Through the efforts to know it, you will be more deceived,

 

You will be more likely to deceive others.


Please remember this fact.

 

One’s making of a truth and the result of opening one’s own eyes to see the truth

Is realized through one’s own efforts.
