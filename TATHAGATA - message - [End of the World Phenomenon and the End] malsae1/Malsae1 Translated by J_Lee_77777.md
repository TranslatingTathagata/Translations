### End of the world phenomenon and the end. End of the world phenomenon,  Is referred to as people not valuing themselves as precious,  And the time will come to live by abandoning themselves and causes them to abandon themselves,  That is the end times.  That is this age.   The end will come at the end times.  That is not the coming of the end.  Rather, a new beginning will arrive.  The end is not the finish, but implies a beginning.   Since the world becomes ruined,  Ruin leads to new beginning,  Dying causes birth,  And birth leads to death  This is the rule and principle of what makes the world to be. &lt;January 30, 1994&gt;
