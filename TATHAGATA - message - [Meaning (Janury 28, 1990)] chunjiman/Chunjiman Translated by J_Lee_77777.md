###Meaning As all creations in the world are  
Caused to be and dispersed by meaning,  
Nothing remains forever,  
And nothing disappears forever either.The heaven gives birth to the world,  And as the world gives birth to god,  God gave birth to life. 
 Blessed are those who know living,  Those that do not know living have no blessings,  The large meaning of living is in this.   
 The one who gave birth to me lives in me,  And I give birth through me,  The past and future of me are in me. Eternal life is in the heart of truthfulness,  Heavenly path is in the heart of truthfulness,  The heavens’, the world’s meaning and god’s meaning were not two.
 Those with wisdom will see only what is there,  Those lacking wisdom will see what is not there,  Everything that is between the heaven and earth are within the meaning.  &lt;January 28, 1990&gt;
