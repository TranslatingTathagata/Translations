Road to Enlightenment

 

After seeing a fact

And wishing to be a person who is able to see truth in that fact

That is the enlightenment.


 

That a human consciousness is an enlightenment

In the course of living


Is as if it works like the earth [soil].


 

Pious acts and mercy are


Like putting good things to that earth.

 

So as good fruit comes from good earth

Good consciousness will arise from that earth.

 

Only in good consciousness can one open oneâ€™s own eyes to one truth.

This is called enlightenment.

 

And this enlightenment is only possible through pious deeds.
