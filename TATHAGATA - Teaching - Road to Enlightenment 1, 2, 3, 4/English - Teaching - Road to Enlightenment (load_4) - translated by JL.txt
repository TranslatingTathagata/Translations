Road to Enlightenment

 

If you have enlightenment after hearing my words


Then you can shine brightly for the world, 

 

But if you come to me and memorize my words,

That leads to futility for the world.

 

If you engage in discussions with others using memory of what youâ€™ve learned from me

There is no meaning in winning arguments over others.
