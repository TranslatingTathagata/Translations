Road to Enlightenment


 

By having interest in me,

And by listening to my words and observing my deeds at least once per week,

You will realize the fact that you know nothing

After 1 year.

 

If you are to verify my words and observe me for another year,


You will then be able to open your eyes to, at last, see what is right and wrong.


That is, by looking at the workings of the world, you will open your eyes to see what is right or wrong, and what is false and true.

You will, to a certain extent, open your eyes to see the truth.

 

If you are to listen to my words, observe my works, and feel [Korean word means to experience deep, moving feeling about] for another year,


Your consciousness will finally awaken and,

Great conscience and courage will begin to arise within your own consciousness.

Then you will be able to practice mercy and pious deeds for the world,

Light up your own life, and attain great enlightenment through your own life.
