Road to Enlightenment

 

Fertile earth [soil] yields good fruit.

 

The way to enlightenment is

A good mind leads to good enlightenment.

A good mind is a result of good deeds.


Enlightenment comes from many experiences and efforts,

As those who have dark minds cannot see the truth,

 

Those who seek enlightenment,

Must first learn good teachings from a good teacher

And by acting on the good teachings, a good mind will be attained

That is, enlightenment is achieved through pious deeds.

 

First, learn about pious deeds,

And learn about how to brighten up the world and the lives of humans

Then by diligently performing the work,

Enlightenment will be attained.
