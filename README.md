## Translating Tathagata



### NOTICE

These are translations made, for the most part, by people who are *completely unfamiliar* with any of Tathagata's teachings. Therefore we don't vouch for the correctness and completeness of any of the translations, and in fact expect there to be multiple errors among them. 

The goal of this repo is to serve as a scalable and long-term solution to aggregate known translations of original Korean-language master copies of content related to Tathagata and his enlightenment.

If you would like to work on a translation of any of Tathagata's words, it's essential that translations be made only from the original Korean, in order to help prevent introduction of compounded inaccuracies. Additionally, always make sure you include the original Korean text. It's also helpful to provide as much notice about who made the translation and disclose all related details and context when possible to prepare readers with the understanding that there is a difference between the accuracy and precision of the translation and the original words.
