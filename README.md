## Translating Tathagata



### NOTICE

These are translations made, for the most part, by people who are *completely unfamiliar* with any of Tathagata's teachings. Therefore we don't vouch for the correctness and completeness of any of the translations, and in fact expect there to be multiple errors among them. 

The goal of this repo is to serve as a scalable and long-term solution to aggregate known translations of original Korean-language master copies of content related to Tathagata and his enlightenment.
