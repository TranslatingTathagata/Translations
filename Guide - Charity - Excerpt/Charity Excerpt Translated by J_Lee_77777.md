Come.See.Listen.And Tell.Then You Will Obtain All That You Want.~~~ This is the most thankful passage among the many that Buddha had said for the purpose of blessing people. However,
What is the reason for instructing
Those unacquainted blinds to ‘Come’.Those blinds who can’t to ‘See’.Those blinds who can’t hear to ‘Listen’.Those blinds who can’t speak to ‘Tell’? People often pray to gods for things that they could not obtain on their own.
To realize what they want according to their actions.
Things that others have, but they themselves do not have.
Good luck, desired luck.
Good life, desired life.
Good future, desired future.
 So, Buddha, who came to this world, taught the ways to obtain what they want.

~~~See.Try intensely to see the existing things and existence (fact).See the fact first.  My words and actions are facts.Try intensely to see what made it exist (truth) out of the existing things and facts.See the truth first.  My words and actions are truths. Listen.Try intensely to listen to the existing things and existence (fact).Listen to the fact first.  My words and actions are facts.Try intensely to listen to what made it exist (truth) out of the existing things and facts.Listen to the truth first.  My words and actions are truths. Tell.Tell my facts and truths to the world.Tell of my words as you have seen and heard and my actions as you have seen and heard.Tell to those that are most precious to you and beloved by you. This is the unique way that I can bless you.Also, it is the only way that you can bless your own selves.  ~~~
  ~~~“I do not want intelligence or enlightenment for myself.  
I only wish to give everyone a chance to obtain good things.  
It will become my pride should others do well and be blessed through my actions.  
If not, my life is a humiliating defeat.  
If I do not take any actions and simply stay put, then I can only see humiliating defeat in myself.  
However, even if I have tried, but do not achieve any results in this world, then that is not my fault.”~~~
