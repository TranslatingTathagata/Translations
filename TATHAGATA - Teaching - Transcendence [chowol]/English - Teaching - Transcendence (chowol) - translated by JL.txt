Transcendence

 

If one does not transcend oneself, seeing things as they are becomes difficult.

Since one can see the things as they are when one transcends oneself

Without overcoming oneself, it is difficult for that person to attain great enlightenment.

It is nearly impossible for anyone, without transcending oneself, to see the things that are in a problem without going through a test [exam].
