Today, the most terrifying enemy that manifests is the situation where humans do not want to understand their problems.
Such phenomenon occurs in the end times and predicts a very bad omen in the future.The todayâ€™s humanity will lead to destruction due to sin and foolishness and every existing civilization will come to be no more.  Life, furthermore, will self-destruct unless the path to redemption is found from the world, and such meaning is the thing that has been predetermined.The world has existed based on this meaning and will continue to exist by the same meaning.The greatest prophecy of all time was that a truthful individual will come in this era, and through him, new path will appear.If there is someone that diligently seeks out the truth in this era, he will attain his life,If there is someone that loses the truthfulness in this era, he will lose everything about himself.&lt;From Pagoda Park, October, 1990&gt;
